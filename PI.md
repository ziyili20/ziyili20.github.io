### Bio


I am is a tenure-track assistant professor in biostatistics at the 
[Department of Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/)
at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and an associate member at [Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC)](https://case.edu/cancer/).

I obtained my Ph.D. degree (2019) in Biostatistics from [Emory University](https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html) under the guidance of
professor [Hao Wu](http://www.haowulab.org/). Before that, I received my MSPH degree (2013) in biostatistics from Emory University and my BS degree (2011)
in biosciences from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). 


I am a statistician focusing on problems in bioinformatics. Developing statistical methods for high-throughput _omics_ data is a major component of my research. I (co-)developed statistical methods [DSS](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html) to 
identify Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) in Bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) data,
[InfiniumPurify](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/InfiniumPurify/index.html) to identify cancer subtypes using DNA methylation microarray data, [cfDNAmethy](https://github.com/haoharryfeng/cfDNAmethy) to deconvolute cell-free DNA methylation signal in plasma using liquid biopsy. I collaborate closely with physicians and wet-lab researchers on various 
projects including cancer, virus, trauma, epidemiology and neurodegenerative disease studies.
